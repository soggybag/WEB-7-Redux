# Web 7 Redux

## Perequisites 

- HTML/CSS/JS 
- React

## Course Overview

Data is the heart of your application. Without data your application 
has little to nothing to present. While data is the heart of your 
content how it is stored and managed is often left as an after 
thought by developers. 

Flux is a pattern that organizes data into a single store, using a 
unidirectional flow to update the store. This creates predictable 
and stable system. Building apps around Flux makes them consistent 
and maintainable. 

This course extends React with Redux. Redux is an easy to implement 
JavaScript implementation of Flux.

The practical goal is to study tools that give you better strategies 
for managing data in your applications. 

## Objectives 

1. Application State
1. Design Patterns with Flux/Redux
1. Component Based Architecture
1. Writing JavaScript ES6

## Competencies

1. Demonstrate a general understanding of application state. Build applications that successfully 
implement data flow using Flux pattern.
1. Organize state into a single state container/source. 
1. Compare and contrast Flux/Redux state management to other systems like MVC.
1. Design and implement applicaton state management system with Flux/Redux.
1. Identify necessary components in component based architecture during the design process.
