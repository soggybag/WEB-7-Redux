# Redux Custom project

This is a project that you will conceive and build. The only requirements are: 

- It must be built with React 
- It must use Redux

## Scope 

Since class is only 6 weeks long and you will have other work and other classes 
you'll need to limit the scope of your project. It is okay to think big and 
imagine a large scale and complex project. For this assignment you can build only 
a subset, proof of concept, or first version of the idea.
